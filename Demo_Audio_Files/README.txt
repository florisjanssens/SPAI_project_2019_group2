The sampling rate in our app was originally 8 kHz but the jury also liked to hear a higher frequency.
Therefore, you can find a folder with audio files recorded during the demo for 8 kHz and 22.05 kHz each.

Most of the files inside follow the name conventions of the evaluation document but there are some exceptions because of the switching around in the app during the demo (however, these exceptions were discussed during the demo).

You can find more information inside the respectable folder of each part for both sampling rates.

Also notice the folder for 22.05 kHz doesn't contain Part_2a_Offline noise reduction, this was because this part of the demo wasn't repeated for 22.05 kHz and only took place for 8 kHz.
