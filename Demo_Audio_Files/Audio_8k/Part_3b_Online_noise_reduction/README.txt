The audio files for Part_3b differ a bit from the requested naming (this was discussed).

part3b_pd_enh00 > part3b_pd > part3b_pd_enh01   were recorded in the indicated sequence.

By switching the noise reduction on and off, the application starts a new recording causing these files to be split up. Also notice there is a small piece of the recording missing compared to the raw signals, this is also caused by the application starting a new recording when noise reduction was turned on or off.

- In part3b_pd_enh00 the noise reduction is turned on.
- In part3b_pd the noise reduction was turned off, causing a new recording to start.
- In part3b_pd_enh01 the noise reduction was turned on again, causing another recording to start.
